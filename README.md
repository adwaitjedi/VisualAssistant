Visual Assistant AI
Welcome to Visual Assistant AI, an artificial intelligence system designed to assist users through voice commands and visual processing capabilities. This project combines computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition to create a versatile assistant capable of performing various tasks.

Features
Object Detection: Detect objects in real-time using YOLOv5 model.
Currency Detection: Identify currency notes using a pre-trained TensorFlow model.
Voice Interaction: Interact with the assistant using voice commands.
Information Retrieval: Retrieve information from Wikipedia.
Web Browsing: Open websites like YouTube, Google, and get weather updates.
Time Display: Get current time information.
Polite Greetings and Farewells: AI greets and says goodbye politely.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Libraries: torch, opencv-python, matplotlib, numpy, pyttsx3, SpeechRecognition, Pillow, wikipedia, tensorflow
Pre-trained YOLOv5 model
Pre-trained currency classification TensorFlow model
Setup Instructions
Install Python 3.x from python.org.
Install required libraries using pip:
Copy code
pip install torch opencv-python matplotlib numpy pyttsx3 SpeechRecognition Pillow wikipedia tensorflow
Download the pre-trained YOLOv5 model and currency classification TensorFlow model.
Ensure your system has a microphone connected if you plan to use voice commands.
Usage
Run the main.py script to start the Visual Assistant AI.
Follow the prompts and speak voice commands to interact with the assistant.
Use commands like "object" for object detection, "currency" for currency detection, "bye" to exit, and more.
